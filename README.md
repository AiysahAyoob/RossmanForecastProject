# RossmanForecastProject

Sales forecasting is an essential element of a business as it provides information to help the
business make important decisions in areas such as inventory management and resource
allocation. When done right, it can help the business make informed decisions which can lead to
overall improvement in productivity and profitability. In order to improve the quality of forecasts
made, it is essential to conduct the right preprocessing steps on the data. As the popular saying
goes; ‘garbage in, garbage out’. Applying the right cleaning and preparation methods on the
dataset can significantly improve the accuracy and usefulness of the predictions.
This report will illustrate and discuss the steps that have been taken to formulate a
forecasting model to predict the sales of the Rossman stores over a period of six weeks. The
store and train datasets were provided to create a prediction on the given test dataset.
